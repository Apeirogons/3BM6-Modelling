# Working Title: The interplay between temperate phages and their hosts

## Lysogeny may carry benefits for the host
Latent bacteriophage lambda exhibits low spontaneous induction rates (1). This low cost to an infected bacterium allows for the evolution of mutualistic behavior (2). One critically important mutualistic behavior is superinfection inhibition, which protects a lysogen from virulent strains of the same viral species which would otherwise lyse the cell (3). In phage lambda, virulence is controlled by the oLoR operator, which is repressed by the lysogeny-favoring CI protein. When another lambda phage infects a lysogen, the existing CI prevents the activation of the oLoR operator, preventing lysis of the lysogen. 

Phages may also transfer or upregulate genes useful for their hosts. In environments containing antibiotics, phages may directly carry antibiotic resistance genes or transduce new ones from one bacterium to another. (4). For some phages of pathogens, various phage-encoded virulence factors have been shown to increase host virulence through upregulating genes such as those related to toxin production and biofilm formation (5). 

Integrated (possibly non-infective) prophages may also effectively act as controllers of bacterial genes (6). In Streptococcus pyogenes, a non-infective phage replicates as an episome during bacterial growth phase. However, as the bacteria enters the stationary phase and begins to starve, the prophage inserts itself into the bacterial genome to render the bacterial mismatch repair system inoperable, resulting in a higher mutation rate favoring bacterial diversity. In some cyanobacterial communities, some cyanobacteria must differentiate into a nitrogen-fixing cell, which is accomplished by the excision of prophages inserted into genes responsible for nitrogen fixation.

In lambda phages, under conditions of host starvation, the probability of lysogeny upon infection increases, signalling that few resources are available for further bacterial (or viral) growth (7). Thus, for the phage, hiding in a bacterium until resource levels increase may be a favorable strategy. Upon choosing lysogeny, these phages reduce the growth rate of their hosts, reducing their overall energy consumption and promoting survival (8). 

However, lysogens do not always confer benefits to their hosts. In the lambda phage-E. coli system, if a lysogen detects DNA stress caused by UV radiation or other means, the DNA repair protein RecA will cleave and inactivate CI, causing the induction of lysis (7). In this case, assuming that this event was random and that there exist other susceptible hosts in the environment, the phage would find it advantageous to escape the stressed host and attempt to find a new one. 


## Deciding on lytic or lysogenic dynamics
Phages entering the lysogenic cycle obtain the capacity for vertical transmission, but drastically reduce their capacity for horizontal transmission (9). Therefore, virulent strains of a bacteriophage may be evolutionarily favored when there exist a large number of susceptible bacteria (7). In contrast, lysogenic forms of phage are favored when most bacteria in a population are not susceptible, as the lysis of any remaining susceptible bacterium would be less valuable than being able to propagate alongside the bacterium.

Phages infecting a cell may also be able to adapt their strategy based on observed features of the outside viral population. In spBeta phages, the propensity for undergoing lysogeny upon infection is dependent on a quorum-sensing (arbitrium) peptide released into the medium by lysogens (10). At high concentrations of arbitrium peptide, a receptor which would normally dimerize binds arbitrium instead. The dimeric form is normally responsible for transcriptionally activating a lysogeny-inhibiting system, thus, increased concentrations of arbitrium promote lysogeny. Similar systems have been found in found in other phage species (11). 

The multiplicity of infection (MOI) may be an indirect measure of the phage-host ratio; a high MOI may indicate that there is significant competition for existing hosts and that it would be disadvantageous to lyse. Thus, in bacteriophage lambda, lysogeny is favored as the multiplicity of infection increases. In particular, evidence suggests that a single infecting lambda phage leads to lysis, while two or more coinfecting phages lead to increasing probabilities of lysogeny (12). Lambda phage may be able to measure the multiplicity of coinfection through the expression of the gene CII; it has been shown that a MOI of 1 leads to low CII activity, while a MOI >= 2 leads to high CII activity (13). In turn, high CII levels cause the production of CI, which favors lysogeny (12).

It has been found that bacterial populations carrying more potent restriction-modification (RM) systems grew to a larger total population and acquired more prophages. This was accomplished by the RM system allowing the bacterial population density to grow, resulting in a larger probability of lysogenization upon phage escape of the RM system (14).
