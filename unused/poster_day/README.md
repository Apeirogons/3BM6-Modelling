# Poster Day 
Collections of up-to-date models, differentials, and other kinds of text, related to poster day. Everything not up-to-date is going to go into /unused.

unified_differentials_github.md describes the equations in a format readable on github.
unified_differentials.md describes the equations in a format not readable on github, but which can be copy-pasted into my LaTeX editor.
unified_model.ipynb is my working file (interactive notebook).
unified_model.R is a downloadable script which does the same thing as unified_model.ipynb.
