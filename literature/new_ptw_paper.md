While looking for a clear explanation of Piggyback-the-Winner, I found something interesting. I’ve quoted the explanation I found below:
 “the recently proposed Piggyback-the-Winner theory of virus–host interactions postulates that at a high host abundance, viruses favour lysogenic infections and integrate into the host genome when those are thriving instead of killing them through a lytic cycle” (1).
This explanation was found in a paper claiming to corroborate PtW results through genomic methods unrelated to the original paper. However, Weitz is an author on a reply to this paper disputing this one as well, although I haven’t read either article in depth (2). I suppose the debate will continue for a while.
