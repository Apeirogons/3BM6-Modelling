# BacterialModels
For HTHSCI 3BM6S. Preliminary mathematical models for lytic-lysogeny decisions... or at least that's what it initially was supposed to be.
Right now, the bacteria are more interesting.

Also, expect scripts and dependencies in a bit. This repo was initially made for myself.

Also, I like the hack for rendering LaTeX on markdown files:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{dN}{dt}\ =\ N V_{max} \frac{R}{R%2BK}">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{dR}{dt}\ =\ -e\frac{dN}{dt}">
